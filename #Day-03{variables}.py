# Python Variables
# Variables are containers for storing data values.

a = 10 #since, a is the variable, which store 10 as a data value

# In python, variables type can not be deceleared explicitly it automatic arranged by the python program
# eg
a = 10
b = "python"
c = 'c' + "c" #in string, use double or single quotation is depends on the programmer to choose, both have same work but best practice is used double quotation for cleaner and readable format
d = 10.25
e = True

# use type command to know the variables are of which segments like int, char, float, string
print(type(a)) #o/p:- int
print(type(b)) #o/p:- string
print(type(c)) #o/p:- string
print(type(d)) #o/p:- float
print(type(e)) #o/p:- boolean

# Note:- python is the case sensitive language both 'a' & 'A' will be considered as different
